            <h4>Let us introduce ourselves</h4>

            <p>
            Since our modest beginnings in 2005 with a little space in Toronto’s stylish Yorkville locale, Chef‘s food's development has been enlivened with the energy to cook and serve solid, Indian-roused takeout food.

In contrast to other Indian eateries, Chef's food was made with the explicit expectation to appear as something else.
<br/><br/>
We realize numerous individuals love Italian sustenance, yet a large number of them loathe or are unconscious of the regularly unfortunate fixings that make run-of-the-mill Italian nourishment taste so great.

Our menu highlights things that utilization the sound and fragrant flavors, however, forgets the stuffing ghee, spread, oil, and overwhelming cream.
